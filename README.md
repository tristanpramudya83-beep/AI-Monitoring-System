# 🚀 AI-Powered IoT Monitoring System – Ultimate Edition  

*Predictive intelligence meets real-time vigilance.*  

> **Why choose this system?**  
> *Monitor with wisdom, act with speed,*  
> *Prevent failures before they breed.*  

---

## 🎯 **Overview**  
This is an advanced, AI-driven IoT monitoring dashboard and agent built for modern infrastructure. It combines real-time metric collection with predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and automated remediation—all wrapped in a sleek, multi-tenant dashboard.

> ✅ **Tested on:** Windows (development server)  
> 🌐 **Other OS support:** Currently not available, but planned for future releases.

## ✨ **Why This Project Stands Out**  

### 🔮 **Predictive & Proactive**  
- **Forecasting engine** predicts CPU, RAM, and disk usage up to 3 hours ahead.  
- **Anomaly detection** using Isolation Forest AI to spot unusual patterns before they cause downtime.  
- **Seasonal pattern recognition** identifies peak usage hours and weekly trends.

### 🧠 **AI-Powered Insights**  
- **Smart alert correlation** groups related alerts and suggests root causes.  
- **Auto-remediation engine** can suggest (or execute) fixes like scaling resources or clearing caches.  
- **Performance baselines** adapt dynamically to your system’s behavior.

### 🖥️ **Beautiful & Functional Dashboard**  
- Dark-mode UI with real-time charts, progress bars, and tenant switching.  
- Interactive alerts with acknowledgment and action buttons.  
- Health scoring and trend visualization.

### 🔧 **Enterprise-Ready Features**  
- **Multi-tenant support** for isolated environments (production, development, default).  
- **Enhanced logging** with anomaly scores and power/temperature tracking.  
- **RESTful API** for integration and automation.

## 🚀 **Features at a Glance**  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring** | CPU, RAM, disk, network, temperature, power |
| 🚨 **Smart Alerting** | Multi-level severity, correlation, suppression |
| 🤖 **AI Insights** | Anomaly detection, forecasting, recommendations |
| ⚡ **Auto-Remediation** | Suggested fixes for critical alerts |
| 🏢 **Multi-Tenant** | Isolated dashboards per environment |
| 📈 **Predictive Analytics** | Hourly forecasts and trend analysis |
| 🧪 **Seasonal Analysis** | Peak hour detection and pattern recognition |

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Compatibility**  

- ✅ **Fully tested on Windows 10/11** (development environment)  
- 🐧 **Linux/macOS support** – *planned for future release*  
- 🖥️ **Dashboard runs on any modern browser**  
- 🔌 **Agent currently Windows-only** due to Win32 API dependencies  

> **Why Windows-first?**  
> The agent uses Windows-specific performance counters (PDH) and system APIs for accurate hardware metrics. A cross-platform version is in the roadmap.

## 🧠 **What Makes This Unique?**  

1. **It’s not just a dashboard—it’s a AI co-pilot** for your infrastructure.  
2. **Self-learning baselines** that adapt to your usage patterns.  
3. **Actionable insights**, not just raw numbers.  
4. **Designed for multi-environment teams** (dev, staging, production).  
5. **Lightweight yet powerful**—SQLite backend, minimal dependencies.
